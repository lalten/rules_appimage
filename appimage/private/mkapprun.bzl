    # The generated AppImage must be able to run outside of Bazel. We conveniently set BUILD_WORKING_DIRECTORY in the
    # to the same value that it would have if the code would be run under `bazel run`. This is important for calculating
    # the actual location of relative paths passed in as user input on command line arguments.
    # We set BUILD_WORKING_DIRECTORY to the first set and not empty value of [BUILD_WORKING_DIRECTORY, OWD, PWD].
    # * $BUILD_WORKING_DIRECTORY (see https://bazel.build/docs/user-manual#running-executables) is set by Bazel in
    #   https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel/blob/7.1.1/src/main/java/com/google/devtools/build/lib/runtime/commands/RunCommand.java#L548
    #   and is only available when Bazel executes the AppImage for us during bazel run (but not test/coverage).
    # * $OWD ("Original Working Directory") is set by the AppImage runtime in
    #   https://github.com/lalten/type2-runtime/blob/84f7a00/src/runtime/runtime.c#L1757.
    #   When the AppImage is mounted with libfuse its working directory is inside the mount point, which is not the
    #   original working directory of the user. Presumably this is why the AppImage runtime sets OWD only when mounted
    #   with libfuse but *not* when running with APPIMAGE_EXTRACT_AND_RUN=1 or --appimage-extract-and-run. See
    #   https://github.com/AppImage/type2-runtime/issues/23).
    # * $PWD is set by the shell to the current working directory. This is correct if and only if we are not running
    #   under Bazel and not mounted with libfuse, so it is a good value to use as a fallback. It's important to store
    #   $PWD to $BUILD_WORKING_DIRECTORY because we change the working directory to the $RUNFILES_DIR below. This means
    #   that at runtime, $PWD is different to the directory that the user ran the appimage from.
    # This is done with POSIX shell command language ${parameter:-word} "Use Default Values" parameter expansion, see
    # https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/utilities/xcu_chap02.html#tag_02_06_02

    # it at build time, it's not guaranteed to be correct or available at runtime.
